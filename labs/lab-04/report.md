By having a license you can tell other contributors what they can do and what they cannot do with the code. This is helpful since it cleas the boundaries of contribution. Also having a license gives others users access to use or modify your code based on the type of the license.

If a project doesn't have a license then all rights are reserved. That means the project is not open software or free. So you won't be able to modify the code without permission from the copyright holders.

I agree with the cliam of the article. Increased computing resources clearly reduced the need for a bare-bones protocol and software. It is for this reason that Gopher was considered as an option primarily for poor institutions that have not had the opportunity to catch up with technology or government agencies who are mandated to serve all types of users, even those with text-only terminals. So in short Gopher was becoming outdated.

.NET Core, MIT license: .NET is being used as base for a lot of apps. Users need freedom to modofy the code to their liking and the MIT license allows that. So with the help of .NET they don't have to start from scratch and make progress much faster. For example in this article the developer had a working prototype in .NET in 20 minutes. This is while if they wanted to do it themselves it would have taken them much longer to complete that task.
