What was said in the article was very accurate. I haven't posted ant questions online but in my experience if you have access to TAs or professors they are a really good source for asking question because they would put time in order to answer the question to the best of their ability. And if not there are many books out there on different topics and one way would be to read the book on the topic you have problems with. 

Jesse used a search engine that was already built by microsoft. So he didn't have to start from scratch. That goes for other project as well. Somebody might have already started the base of your project but you might want to add some features so if that project is open source you can simply leverage it and use it to make your own product. One other thing to take away from this reading don't ever violate copy right laws eventhough Jesse was right the fact that you won't be able to find work at places properly anymore is awful.
